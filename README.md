## Group Project
San Francisco, a city-county located in the Bay Area region of Northern California, was ranked as the city with the highest average monthly rental costs for 1-bedroom apartments in the US in 2018 (Lane, 2019). With the Bay Area becoming a rising business hub for companies to thrive in, rising costs of living have been observed not only in San Francisco, but also in the other counties in the surrounding Bay Area.
In light of a growing demand for rental spaces in the Bay Area amidst rising rental costs, we seek to answer the following question regarding rental prices in the Bay Area:

**Where should you rent your one-bedroom apartment in the Bay Area?**

To do so, we will be using the dataset on San Francisco Rentals in 2018 obtained from [tidytuesday/data/2022/2022-07-05/](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-07-05).
